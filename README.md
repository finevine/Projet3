Design of the maze
--------------------------
The structure of the maze (P3-Labyrinthe.ods) can be edited as a spreassheet :
- 0 for tiles unaccessibles
- for accessible tiles :
    - 1 for classic tiles
    - 2 for departure
    - 3 for arrival

The file is to export as a csv (separator ";")
The maze has to be well designed:
- no isolated tile
- it can be traveled without problem (it's possible to finish the game)
